MD5 Hash Prefixer
=================

MD5 Hash Prefixer takes all the files in a specified folder, creates a MD5 hash for all the file names and then prefixes that hash to each file name. Note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature.

The files are all backed up before the process is undertaken.
