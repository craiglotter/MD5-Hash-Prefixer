To append a MD5 hash string to your files, you need to first select a folder to operate on by clicking on the Browse button and selecting a relevant folder. Please note that the folder parsing is not recursive in nature, meaning all your files need to be located in the selected folder.

Note that the MD5 hash is generated and then altered slightly by stripping out all disallowed characters and replacing them with an 'x' (These include \/|:*?"<>|+=-).

Once you have selected all your input options, simply click on the Begin button to launch the process. Note that the Cancel button will allow you to cancel a currently running rename operation.

(Note that a backup folder is created each time the application runs an operation.)
